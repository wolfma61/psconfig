# Introduction

This is a blueprint for a common Powershell configuration script used on my machines. A intro into Powershell configuration is on [Technet](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb613488).

The steps described here will overwrite any existing Powershell configuration! To get this project on a new machine follow these steps from a Powershell command:

- In your `$env:USERPROFILE` directory change into the `Documents\WindowsPowerShell` folder (create the directory if required).
- Enlist in this github project

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/wolfma61/psconfig.git
```
